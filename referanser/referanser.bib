	abstract = {In short-term studies, block periodization of high-intensity training (HIT) has been shown to be an effective strategy that enhances performance and related physiological factors. However, long-term studies and detailed investigations of macro, meso, and micro- periodization of HIT blocks in world-class endurance athletes are currently lacking. In a recent study, we showed that the world’s most successful cross-country (XC) skier used two different periodization models with success throughout her career. One including extensive use of HIT blocks, namely BP, and one using a traditional method namely TRAD. In this study, we compare BP with TRAD in two comparable successful seasons and provide a detailed description of the annual use of HIT blocks in BP. The participant is the most-decorated winter Olympian, with 8 Olympic gold medals, 18 world championship titles, and 114 world cup victories. Training data was categorized by training form (endurance, strength, and speed), intensity [low (LIT), moderate (MIT), and HIT], and mode (running, cycling, and skiing/roller skiing). No significant difference was found in the total endurance training load between BP and TRAD. However, training volume in BP was lower compared to TRAD (15 ± 6 vs. 18 ± 7 h/wk, P = 0.001), mainly explained by less LIT (13 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 5 h/wk, P = 0.004). Lower volume of MIT was also performed in BP compared to TRAD (13 vs. 38 sessions/year), whereas the amount of HIT was higher in BP (157 vs. 77 sessions/year). While BP included high amounts of HIT already from the first preparation period, followed by a reduction toward the competition period, TRAD had a progressive increase in HIT toward the competition period. In BP, the athlete performed seven HIT blocks, varying from 7 to 11 days, each including 8–13 HIT sessions. This study provides novel insights into successful utilization of two different periodization models in the worlds best XC skier, and illustrates the macro, meso and micro- periodization of HIT blocks to increase the overall amount of HIT.},

	doi = {doi: 10.1111/sms.12016},
	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two different methods of organizing endurance training in trained cyclists during a 12-week preparation period. One group of cyclists performed block periodization (BP; n = 8), wherein every fourth week constituted five sessions of high-intensity aerobic training (HIT), followed by 3 weeks of one HIT session. Another group performed a more traditional organization (TRAD; n = 7), with 12 weeks of two weekly HIT sessions. The HIT was inter- spersed with low-intensity training (LIT) so that similar total volumes of both HIT and LIT were performed in the two groups. BP achieved a larger relative improvement in VO2max than TRAD (8.8  5.9\% vs 3.7  2.9\%, respec- tively, P {\textless} 0.05) and a tendency toward larger increase in power output at 2 mmol/L [la-] (22  14\% vs 10  7\%, respectively, P = 0.054). Mean effect size (ES) of the rela- tive improvement in VO2max, power output at 2 mmol/L [la-], hemoglobin mass, and mean power output during 40-min all-out trial revealed moderate superior effects of BP compared with TRAD training (ES range was 0.62– 1.12). The present study suggests that BP of endurance training has superior effects on several endurance and performance indices compared with TRAD.},

	doi = {DOI 10.1007/s00421-010-1455-1},
	abstract = {Abstract Attempting to achieve the high diversity of training goals in modern competitive alpine skiing simulta- neously can be diYcult and may lead to compromised over- all adaptation. Therefore, we investigated the eVect of block training periodization on maximal oxygen consump- tion (VO2max) and parameters of exercise performance in elite junior alpine skiers. Six female and 15 male athletes were assigned to high-intensity interval (IT, N = 13) or control training groups (CT, N = 8). IT performed 15 high-intensity aerobic interval (HIT) sessions in 11 days. Sessions were 4 £ 4 min at 90–95\% of maximal heart rate separated by 3-min recovery periods. CT continued their conventionally mixed training, containing endurance and strength sessions. Before and 7 days after training, subjects performed a ramp incremental test followed by a high- intensity time-to-exhaustion (tlim) test both on a cycle ergometer, a 90-s high-box jump test as well as counter- movement (CMJ) and squat jumps (SJ) on a force plate. IT signiWcantly improved relative VO2max by 6.0\% (P {\textless} 0.01; male +7.5\%, female +2.1\%), relative peak power output by 5.5\% (P {\textless} 0.01) and power output at ventilatory threshold 2 by 9.6\% (P {\textless} 0.01). No changes occurred for these mea- sures in CT. tlim remained unchanged in both groups. High-box jump performance was signiWcantly improved in males of IT only (4.9\%, P {\textless} 0.05). Jump peak power (CMJ ¡4.8\%, SJ ¡4.1\%; P {\textless} 0.01), but not height decreased in IT only. For competitive alpine skiers, block periodization of HIT oVers a promising way to eYciently improve VO2max and performance. Compromised explosive jump performance might be associated with persisting muscle fatigue.},
